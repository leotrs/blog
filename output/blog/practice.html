                <p>This past weekend I was watching The Expanse and an idea came to mind. (If
you like sci-fi you should totally go watch The Expanse instead of reading
my blog. However, if for whatever reason you feel a burning desire to read
my blog right now, don't worry, I won't spoil The Expanse for you.)</p>
<p>There is this scene in early season 2 where, soon after a combat
engagement, the pilot of one of the ships sits down at the helm and starts
going through the records of the battle. He does so because, even if that
battle could be declared a victory, he feels uncomfortable with the fact
that they had sustained considerable casualties. He feels uncomfortable
with the outcome, he is accountable. He then proceeds to run a simulation
of the battle, and goes through it again and again and again, for hours on
end, until he gets the timing of his decisions and maneuvers exactly
right. He's not practicing for victory, and I would argue he is not
practicing for perfection: he is practicing for mastery.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Practice makes <s>perfect</s> master</h3>
<p>I spend much of my grad student life thinking about grad student life. I
worry about the quality of my code and my writing, the correctness of my
algorithms and the persuasiveness of my manuscripts. I worry about
carefully choosing interesting research projects, and I worry about not
over-exerting myself. I worry about nurturing my relationships just as much
as I do my work. I would go as far as to say that my work is just another
relationship I must nurture â€“yes, "just" another one.</p>
<p>One thing I haven't been worrying about enough is <em>practice</em>. In academia,
much of the emphasis is put on the next big discovery, the next paper, the
next conference, and everybody assumes that everybody else (and themselves)
are above and beyond the fundamental concepts. After all, how could you be
in academia without a mastery of the fundamentals of your field?</p>
<p>Well, here's an unsurprising confession. I am a master of nothing. I
majored in mathematics (and I would do it again), and I can grade papers,
homeworks, and exams of undergraduate (and some graduate) level mathematics
courses. I can read scholarly papers and don't blink twice at math jargon
and notation, and I have been known to find mistakes in others' work. But
none of that means I have mastered undergraduate mathematics (forget
anything beyond undergraduate level).</p>
<p>I think it's a terrible mistake to believe that since I already made it to
grad school, I should not concern myself with the lowly life of the
fundamental concepts anymore. In fact, one of the main reasons I came to
grad school is <em>because</em> I want to keep studying. If I felt like I mastered
these topics, I wouldn't be a student. With this observation, the only
reasonable outcome is to embrace my ignorance and accept the fact that I am
not a master of any topic, however basic or fundamental it may be
considered.</p>
<p>However, if not a master yet, I would like to be proficient at using
several tools and excellent at a number of skills that will help me in the
academic journey I have embarked on. Therefore, I conclude I need to
<em>practice</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>I must not neglect the basics</h3>
<p>I have thus decided to adopt a new rule in my academic life: never neglect
the basics. I will stop assuming that something is easy just because it is
fundamental, and I will stop assuming that others are comfortable in their
knowledge of it. This is a touchy subject, because academia is known for
big egos and not enough time, while I am trying to force myself to be
humble and to spend time revising the basics. It's OK to be proud of one's
achievements, and it's OK to be conservative with one's own time, as long
as that pride and jealousy are put to good use in the continuing of any
scientific (or personal) endeavor. They are never OK as cheap excuses, or
when used exclusively for pomp and grand-standing.</p>
<p>Thus, I plan on embracing the fact that I <em>need</em> practice, and not having
<em>time is not an excuse</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Practice what, exactly?</h3>
<p>The next step is to identify the skills that I consider "fundamental"
and/or the ones I want to achieve mastery at. To my (genuine but naive)
surprise, I don't know what these skills are. In effect, I'm asking what
are the skills that will make me a successful grad student and, indeed, a
successful scientist. After much thought and discussion with peers, I
arrived at the following list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quantitative reasoning</strong>: numerics and on-the-fly estimation,
   statistics, data-driven or evidence-driven analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract reasoning</strong>: mathematical argumentation and proof-writing,
   algorithm/system design and programming.</li>
<li><strong>Communication skills</strong>: presentation, dialogue, writing.</li>
<li><strong>Creative skills</strong>: thinking "out of the box", exploration of ideas,
   following a "hunch".</li>
<li><strong>Subject matter</strong> (in my personal case): network science, complexity
   science, algorithm design and implementation, topology and geometry of
   interconnected systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is by no means a complete list, nor do I mean to say that each of
these is as important as the rest.</p>
<hr />
<h3>An experiment</h3>
<p>As everything else, I will treat this as an experiment. I will try to
choose activities that cover the above skills and systematically practice
them with some frequency. (I say "with some frequency" and not "as
frequently as possible" because of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>.)</p>
<p>To start with, I have decided to set apart some time each week to (i) dig
out my undergraduate linear algebra textbook and solve every exercise and
write down every proof, and (ii) continue development of
<a href="http://www.erdosnet.work">erdos</a>. Combined, these two activities will
tackle skills in numbers 2 and (partially) 4, and 5 in the above list. I
have yet to decide how to tackle numbers 1, and 3 systematically.</p>
<p>As the experiment that this is, I am open to trial and error, and learning
from my mistakes. Maybe I have chosen to dedicate too little time to these
activities, or too much. Maybe I should be spending my time doing something
else altogether. If that happens, it should be an easy adjustment to fix
and iron out those wrinkles. After all, everything is a draft.</p>

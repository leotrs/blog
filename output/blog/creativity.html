                <p>In my previous <a href="http://leotrs.com/blog/practice.html">post</a> I talked about
practicing fundamental skills that I, as a grad student, would like to
master. However, I also mentioned that there are some "creative skills"
that I do not now how to practice. Among these creative skills are the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>thinking "outside the box" (problem solving),</li>
<li>freed exploration of ideas (mind wandering),</li>
<li>following a hunch (developing an argument),</li>
<li>crafting (creating something from scratch),</li>
</ol>
<p>A question raised by these broad view of "creativity" is what do we mean
when we say that scientists are creative? Creative scientists are known for
designing clever experiments, or explaining complex concepts in simple
terms, or (in retrospect) for making observations that may seem obvious
after the fact.</p>
<h2>How to practice being creative?</h2>
<p>The question is now: how to practice these skills? Here are some ideas
after brainstorming with my friends and SO:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get an instrument and compose simple melodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative cooking: invent your own recipes on the go. My girlfriend and I
   often cook together and we decided to do the following: one person
   chooses an ingredient at random, then the other person chooses an
   ingredient they think would go well with the first one, and so we
   continue taking turns adding ingredients (or cooking and preparation
   methods) until we come up with a recipe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/">Explain complex concepts with simple words</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-frame the question: given a research question, identity the
   assumptions underlying it, the constraints that a solution must satisfy,
   and the tools available to solve it. Then, try to "perturb" those
   components: what happens when we add/remove one assumption leaving all
   others intact? What happens when a solution only partially satisfies the
   constraints? What do the ideal tools to answer this question look like?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a space for practicing: I have found that when I am in a creative
   mood (or performing creative activities) I frequently stand up and start
   pacing around the room. I usually listen to background music when
   "thinking hard". I usually write down notes and look up definitions on
   the internet. A space designed to sustain creative activities must
   satisfy all these constraints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lifelong Kindergarten</h2>
<p>I just finished reading
<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/mres/overview/">Mitch Resnick's</a>
excellent new
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/lifelong-kindergarten">book</a>. There are
three main takeaways I took from it.</p>
<h3>The creative learning spiral</h3>
<p>Imagine -&gt; Create -&gt; Play -&gt; Share -&gt; Reflect -&gt; Imagine -&gt; ...  The
creative learning spiral is Resnick's operationalization of a child's
creative process. I have tried to adapt it to both programming and science.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Programming: Design -&gt; Implement -&gt; Test -&gt; Deploy -&gt; Design -&gt; ...  The
   creative learning spiral has obvious parallels with
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iterative development</a>
   in software engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science: Observe -&gt; Hypothesize -&gt; Experiment -&gt; Publish -&gt; Address
   feedback -&gt; Observe -&gt; ... Again, the creative learning spiral has
   parallels with the
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What's interesting here is not that there are parallels (this is hardly
surprising), but that the emphasis in the creative learning spiral is to
<strong>learn</strong> through actively engaging with the world, which is only achieved
by following all steps of the spiral multiple times. Resnick doesn't put
more emphasis on one step of the spiral compared to the others. However,
there does seem to be a focus in deployment (software), and publishing
(academia) in the other spirals I proposed. Why? Unfortunately, I think
that the reason is that the purpose of the other two spirals is not to
<strong>learn</strong> (or create or develop) but rather, to <strong>produce</strong>.</p>
<h3>Deliver and Enable</h3>
<p>The book finishes with some recommendations for people who want to empower
children. One comment that made an impression on me was that Resnick
recommends designers and developers to design technologies that <strong>enable</strong>
children to create their own experiences, as opposed to <strong>delivering</strong>
education, entertainment, or other content for easy consumption. For
example, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is designed to enable children
to create their own stories and find their own creative voices, rather than
for them to beat levels or acquire points. (Resnick explains why the
Scratch team has actively avoided the gamification of the system so as to
avoid competition and encourage collaboration and creation.)</p>
<p>What does this mean for academia? Are scientific publications designed to
<strong>enable</strong> other scientists to do their jobs better? Or are they designed
to <strong>deliver</strong> cutting-edge knowledge? In this case, I don't think that
scientific publications <em>should</em> adhere to either one or the other
purpose. In fact, I have decided to start evaluating the papers I read in
terms of what they are delivering (is it a new efficient algorithm, or a
piece of interesting theory?) and enabling (what does the paper do for me?
Can I use its contents and apply them to my own research?).</p>
<h3>Other tips</h3>
<p>The final section of the book is a gold mine for someone who, like me, is
looking for advice on how to lead a more consciously creative life. I won't
copy all the advice here - I heartily recommend that you read the book
instead.</p>

  <h1>My interpretation of "Some observations on the smallest adjacency eigenvalue of a graph", by Cioaba et al.</h1>
  <h2>Rewrite of Theorem 2.1</h2>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>

  <p class="l-gutter">
    It is understood that \(V_j \subset V \) and \(w_j(uv) = 0\) if either
    \(u\) or \(v\) is not in \(H^j\).
  </p>

  <p>
    This result concerns a weighted graph \( G (V, w) \) and a collection
    of graphs \( D = \{ H^j (V_j, w_j) \}_{j=1}^{m} \) such that

    \[ w(uv) = \sum_j w_j (uv) \]

    for each edge \(uv\) in \(G\). In this case, \(D\) is called a
    <em>decomposition</em> of \( G \).
  </p>

  <p class="l-gutter">
    \( \lambda(H) := \min_i \{ \lambda_i: \lambda_i \text{ is an eigenvalue of } H \} \)
    \( D_u := \{ H^j \in D: u \in H^j \} \)
    \( \lambda(D_u) := \sum_{H \in D_u} \lambda(H)\)
  </p>

  <p>
    The main goal is to show how to use such a decomposition to find lower
    bounds for the smallest adjacency eigenvalue of \(G\). In the
    following, let \( \lambda(H) \) be the smallest adjacency eigenvalue of
    a graph \(H\). Further, let \(D_u\) be the set of graphs in \(D\) that
    contain \(u\), and define \( \lambda(D_u) \) as the sum of \(
    \lambda(H) \) across all \(H\) that contain \(u\).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Theorem (2.1 in [??])</b> Let \(D = \{ H^j \}\) be a decomposition
    of \(G\). Then,
    \[ \lambda(G) \geq \min_u \lambda(D_u). \]
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Proof</em> foo bar.

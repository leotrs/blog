I rarely share the things that go
through my mind outside of a very close circle of family and friends, let
alone publish them on the interwebs. This is my third time trying to write
a blog, and something tells me this is the one that will stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly, I stopped writing on the other blogs because I thought my ideas
were not mature enough. So, from today onward I am treating everything as a
draft. No matter how (im)mature an idea, if I think it’s interesting, it
goes on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consequence, every time you read anything on this website of mine,
remember that it is only a draft, and any and all comments, corrections,
and refutations will be more than welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across this mindset when &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.net/"&gt;Wil Wheaton&lt;/a&gt;
shared the
&lt;a href="http://www.manifestoproject.it/bre-pettis-and-kio-stark/"&gt;Cult of Done Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.
Many of the other rules are worth a look too, though I don't subscribe to
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking "everything is a draft" as a rule makes this only the second
time I subscribe to such a guideline in everyday life. The other one tells
me to &lt;strong&gt;only do things that are necessary, interesting, or fun, and only
while they are necessary, interesting, or fun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand by these two rules, they've served me well up to now. I don’t know
how far they will take me in academia, though. But if they don't work, and
either stops being necessary, interesting, or fun, then I can just drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, they're just a draft.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rules"></category><category term="draft"></category></entry></feed>

Leo is interested in the intersection of Network Science, Complexity
Science, and Neuroscience. By using different approaches from Computer
Science, like graph mining and machine learning, he is trying to uncover
the underlying principles governing the interplay between structure and
function of dynamical networks. Leo has a B.S in Mathematics from
Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, and is a self-taught programmer,
having attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a
programmers retreat in NYC, to focus on algorithm design and high-quality
code writing standards.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing semicolons
and whitespace on a text editor.

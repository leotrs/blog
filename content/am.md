I am broadly interested in the intersection of Network Science, Complexity
Science, and Mathematics.  I specialize in introducing novel mathematical
and computational tools to the network science toolbox. Keywords are
differential geometry, metric geometry, algebraic topology, spectral linear
algebra, graph mining, representation learning, machine learning.  I
strongly adhere to the belief that *code is science*, and thus I put
especial emphasis on high-quality code writing standards.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from
[*Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú*](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/), and
I am a self-taught programmer.  I have taught mathematics (analysis and
calculus, in Perú) and Spanish (in the U.S.A.) at the undergraduate level.
I was a Research Programmer at
[Wolfram Research South America](https://www.wolfram.com/).  I have
attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a programmers
retreat, to focus on algorithm design and code writing standards.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing
semicolons and whitespace on a text editor.

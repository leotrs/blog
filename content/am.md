I am broadly interested in the intersection of Network Science, Complexity
Science, and Mathematics.  In my research, I hold in high regard both
understanding (through models and theory), and computing (through learning
and mining).  Thus, I study the principles underlying complex networks by
using different fields of mathematics, such as differential and metric
geometry, and algebraic topology; and different computational approaches
such as graph mining and machine learning.  Currently, the main objective
of my research is to introduce novel mathematical tools to the network
science toolbox, and design efficient algorithms around them to uncover
previously unknown features of networks.  I strongly adhere to the belief
that *code is science*, and thus I put especial emphasis on high-quality
code writing standards.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from
[*Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú*](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/), and
I am a self-taught programmer.  I have taught mathematics (analysis and
calculus, in Perú) and Spanish (in the U.S.A.) at the undergraduate level.
I was a Research Programmer at
[Wolfram Research South America](https://www.wolfram.com/).  I have
attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a programmers
retreat, to focus on algorithm design and code writing standards.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing
semicolons and whitespace on a text editor.

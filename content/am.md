I am interested in the intersection of Network Science, Complexity Science,
and Mathematics. By using different approaches from Computer Science, like
graph mining and machine learning, and different fields of Mathematics,
such as metric geometry and algebraic topology, I study the underlying
principles governing the interplay between structure and function of
networks. Leo has a B.S in Mathematics from Pontificia Universidad Católica
del Perú, and is a self-taught programmer, having attended the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a programmers retreat in NYC, to
focus on algorithm design and high-quality code writing standards.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing semicolons
and whitespace on a text editor.

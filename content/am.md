I am a grad student in
[Network Science](http://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at
[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), a program I
**very much** recommend.

I have a Bachelor's in Science in Math from
[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/), a
university which, aside from the Math department, I **do not** recommend.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing semicolons
and whitespace on a text editor.

I am a bipedal mammal, of genus *Homo*, species *sapiens*, living on planet
Earth for the moment (specifically, Boston, MA, USA). I was manufactured in
1992, in Lima, Perú, and identify as male if that's of any interest to you.

I am a person, a friend, a teacher, a programmer, a scientist, a
[recurser](https://www.recurse.com), a swimmer, a biker, 2x son, 2x
brother, 35x cousin, 12x nephew, 1x uncle, 4x grandson, 8x great-grandson,
etc.

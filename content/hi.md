I am a PhD candidate at the [Network Science
Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.com/) at [Northeastern
University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), under the advisement of [Tina
Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/).  I am broadly interested in the intersection
of Network Science, Complexity Science, and Mathematics.  I specialize in
applying spectral methods to solve machine learning or data mining tasks on
networks.  I strongly adhere to the belief that *code is science*, and thus I
put special emphasis on high-quality code writing standards.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from [*Pontificia Universidad Católica del
Perú*](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/), and I am a self-taught programmer.  I have
taught mathematics (analysis and calculus, in Perú) and Spanish (in the U.S.A.)
at the undergraduate level.  I was a Research Programmer at [Wolfram Research
South America](https://www.wolfram.com/).  I have attended the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com), a programmers retreat, to focus on algorithm
design and code writing standards.  I spend a lot of my time staring at empty
whiteboards and typing whitespace on text editors.

Here's some of my [research interests](/projects.html) and my
[publications](/science.html).

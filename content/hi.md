I am a PhD candidate at the [Network Science
Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.com/) at [Northeastern
University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), under the advisement of [Tina
Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/). I am broadly interested in the
intersection of Network Science, Complexity Science, and Mathematics.  I
specialize in introducing novel mathematical and computational tools to the
network science toolbox. Some of my particular interests are differential
geometry, metric geometry, algebraic topology, spectral linear algebra,
graph mining, representation learning, machine learning.  I strongly adhere
to the belief that *code is science*, and thus I put especial emphasis on
high-quality code writing standards.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from
[*Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú*](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/), and
I am a self-taught programmer.  I have taught mathematics (analysis and
calculus, in Perú) and Spanish (in the U.S.A.) at the undergraduate level.
I was a Research Programmer at
[Wolfram Research South America](https://www.wolfram.com/).  I have
attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a programmers
retreat, to focus on algorithm design and code writing standards.

I spend a lot of my time staring at an empty whiteboard or typing
semicolons and whitespace on a text editor.

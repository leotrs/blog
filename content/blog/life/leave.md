Summary: and I never feel like dancing
Slug: leave


Ten years ago I decided I would become an academic to study how humans'
brains work.  Everything I've done ever since has, in one way or another,
pushed me a bit closer to that goal.

Today, I'm jumping on a plane and moving to Boston, where I will be
attending the world's first
[PhD program in Network Science](http://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/).
I will specialize in Network Neuroscience, aka
[Connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics).

I feel like dancing.  I *never* feel like dancing.

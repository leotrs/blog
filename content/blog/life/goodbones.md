Summary: A poem.
Slug: goodbones


I found this poem on the morning of Nov 9th, 2016.

Since we're talking about a poem, I will steal a bit of artistic license
and say that *the poem found me* on that morning, as I wasn't looking for
it. In fact, I wasn't looking for anything in particular, I was just
watching my Twitter feed roll up and up with endless comments and news
pieces.


### Good Bones

#### BY MAGGIE SMITH

> Life is short, though I keep this from my children.

> Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine

> in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,

> a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways

> I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least

> fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative

> estimate, though I keep this from my children.

> For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.

> For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,

> sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world

> is at least half terrible, and for every kind

> stranger, there is one who would break you,

> though I keep this from my children. I am trying

> to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,

> walking you through a real shithole, chirps on

> about good bones: This place could be beautiful,

> right? *You could make this place beautiful*.

It's been a month and a half, and most mornings I still watch my feed roll
up endlessly, and I try to remember that at least half the world is bad,
but I must try to make it more beautiful.

Title: Everything is a draft

Summary: and that's OK
Slug: draft


With this blog, I’m trying something new. I rarely share the things that go
through my mind outside of a very close circle of family and friends, let
alone publish them on the interwebs. This is my third time trying to write
a blog, and something tells me this is the one that will stick.

Mainly, I stopped writing on the other blogs because I thought my ideas
were not mature enough. So, from today onward I am treating everything as a
draft. No matter how (im)mature an idea, if I think it’s interesting, it
goes on here.

In consequence, every time you read anything on this website of mine,
remember that it is only a draft, and any and all comments, corrections,
and refutations will be more than welcome.

I first came across this mindset when [Wil Wheaton](http://wilwheaton.net/)
shared the
[Cult of Done Manifesto](http://www.manifestoproject.it/bre-pettis-and-kio-stark/).
Many of the other rules are worth a look too, though I don't subscribe to
all.

Taking "everything is a draft" as a rule makes this only the second
time I subscribe to such a guideline in everyday life. The other one tells
me to **only do things that are necessary, interesting, or fun, and only
while they are necessary, interesting, or fun**.

I stand by these two rules, they've served me well up to now. I don’t know
how far they will take me in academia, though. But if they don't work, and
either stops being necessary, interesting, or fun, then I can just drop it.

After all, they're just a draft.

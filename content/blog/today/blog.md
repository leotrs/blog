Summary: and it was fun!
Slug: blog

Today I created this blog. I used [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a
site generator written in Python for static sites like this one and
[erdosnet.work](http://www.erdosnet.work) (yes, I did that one too). I
chose [pelican-blue](https://github.com/Parbhat/pelican-blue/) for the
theme. Thanks, [Parbhat](https://parbhatpuri.com/)!

The theme was a bit broken and I had to dive into CSS (something I
dislike), until I got a somewhat functional sticky footer, static home
page, pages with subtitles, and other things all working (something I
love!).

Update: I have since changed the theme. I'm now using the wonderful
[pelican-bootstrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3).

I also added the RC ad on the footer down there. If you want to be a better
programmer, you should very very much click on it.

This was fun!

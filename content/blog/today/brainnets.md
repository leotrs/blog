Summary: and what sets them apart from other networks
Slug: brainnets


Today was my second day in grad school.  After being assigned a couple
papers, and asked a few times where I see myself in five years (after I
graduate), I have had to deal with the fact that there is no official
Neuroscience (brain networks) group at my program yet.

I'm happy to dedicate all of my time to networks in general (that's what I
came here for), but I need some sort of general framework to think about
brain networks while doing more fundamental Network Science research.  For
this, I started thinking about describing brain networks in purely NetSci
terms.  Here's what I have right now (I'm sure this is going to change in
the future):

Brain networks are networks that

1. are large (tens of billions of nodes, trillions of edges),
2. are dynamical (there's a temporal process developing on top of its
   structure),
3. compute information (as opposed to just spreading it),
4. have evolved over time (in the strict sense, meaning Natural Selection).

Features 1. and 2. are common in the NetSci literature these days.
Feature 3. is a bit trickier, although I'm not sure there's a huge
difference in networks that relay/spread information and networks that
compute it.  (Is computation just a side effect of information spreading
through specialized circuits?)  Networks with feature 4. can be found
elsewhere in Network Biology: metabolomes, proteomes, etc.

Right now, I'll dedicate most of my time to thinking about networks in
general, and in particular to applying my findings to network datasets that
are large, dynamic, computational, and evolved.


Update: after discussing with a colleague, now I believe that some
socio-political networks are also capable of computation. The input would
be public opinion or an ideology, and the output would be policy.  I wonder
if this is a way to reconcile the view of society as a super-organism.  Do
all networks under natural selection perform computations? Do all organism
networks perform computation? Can an ant colony be said to compute?
